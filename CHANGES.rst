Changelog
=========

4.4 (unreleased)
----------------

- Reverted connection reconnect patch from version 4.3. It did not work as
  expected.


4.3 (2025-10-07)
----------------

- Ensure connections always reconnect deterministically after a server
  disconnect (or crash).
  Previously the pool may have harboured long-running connections that only
  got reconnected when the pool felt like returning it to the application.
  Those connections can easily have lingered for a long time, causing
  user-visible errors long after the original problem was fixed, e.g. when
  the server has restarted a couple of hours ago.
